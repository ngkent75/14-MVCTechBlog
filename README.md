## Description
This project is a tech blog. Upon entering the homepage, you can view other people's blog posts. If you want to interact with the website, you must sign in first. Clicking on anything other than the home page button will redirect you to the sign in page. You can sign up and have your information stored, allowing you to sign in again later. You have the option to create and delete your own blog post or view other people's posts. There's a textbox for commenting on blog posts, however that has not been implemented yet.

```md
AS A developer who writes about tech
I WANT a CMS-style blog site
SO THAT I can publish articles, blog posts, and my thoughts and opinions
```

## Usage

1. Upon accessing the website, you will immediately see the homepage.

2. From the home page, clicking on any link other than the home link will redirect you to the login page.
3. While on the login screen, you can sign up and be directed towards a page that allows you to create or delete a blog post.
4. Creating a blog post will make it generate on the homepage.
5. On the homepage, you will see a list of all posts, who created them, and when they were posted.
6. Clicking on a post redirects you to a page that shows the contents of the post. There is a comment box, but that has not been fully implemented yet so it won't work.
7. After signing up, you can come back later and sign in anytime.

Your README should look something like this:
